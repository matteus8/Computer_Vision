Basic Cats and Dogs classification using vgg16_classification model

This model is able to identifiy a cat or when given an image of a cat or dog respecticly. Much similar to how
google photos is able to do object dectection.

I got my data from Kaggle --> https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/cats-and-dogs-image-classification


This is an introduction and demo on how classification works. It's a bit messy, and has it's quircks, however the model that was
desigined using the vgg16 model does it's job overall.
